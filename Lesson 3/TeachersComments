Great idea, but unfortunately it's not helping :( The problem is in inner join between sales and receipts. Rows won't be joined if receipt_id is null and that is what you're wanting to filter.
Correct answer:

SELECT Название
FROM Фирмы-производители 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT преп.id_фирмы
				FROM Фармпрепараты преп
						JOIN Продажи прод ON преп.id=прод.id_фармпрепарата
						JOIN Кассовые_чеки чек ON прод.id_чека=чек.id 
				WHERE YEAR(Дата)=2019)

"Like" requires strings. You needed to use 'A'.
